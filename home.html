                <h2>Why did I choose software development</h2>
                <p>I think that software development is a really powerful tool. We can do so much with applications now, like tracking upcoming events and appointments,
                    make shopping lists, track exercise habits, manage medical conditions such as diabetes, etc. 
                    you cannot go ANYWHERE without someone having a phone or smart device with them. Cars are smart too!
                    One day I hope to be able to innovate technology people will utilize everyday. After working jobs that didn't go anywhere, 
                    I did not feel fulfulled. I was not doing anything to push forward and that really upset me, so I choose the field that I felt had the brightest future </p>

                    <h2>About my HomeTown</h2>
                    <p>Around 1914, Oak Park became its own subdivision, seperare from Royal Oak Township. During this time the GI Bill was passed, aiding Veterans in buying houses.
                        Because of the GI bill in the late 50s, the population went from 5000 to more than 36000. A lot of European immigrants who settled in Detroit ended up moving there,
                        which is why when you visit there now, there are a lot of Jewish Americans of the orthodox faith there.
                    </p>
